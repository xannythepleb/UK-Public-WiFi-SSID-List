# UK Public WiFi SSID List

List of the most frequently used UK public WiFi names.

Most are generic for widely found routers, providers, hotels, restaurants, etc while others are location specific e.g. London Underground, bus and train companies, and various local council hotspots.

Scan for WiFi in any busy area in the UK and you will almost certainly find at least one SSID on this list.

Made this a repo rather than a gist so it can be open to PRs and in there is the potential to create separate categorised lists for location specific SSIDs and so on.

All SSIDs in this list are publicly broadcast. What you do with them is not my responsibility. If you load them into PineAP or similar, only do so for white hat pentesting purposes. It is on you to follow all applicable local laws and regulations.
